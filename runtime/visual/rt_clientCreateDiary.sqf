Admins have access to debug console and Zeus, if needed they can assist if something breaks or a bug is found.<br/><br/>

All air vehicles are located on deck, all land vehicles are located middle deck and there are also patrol boats at the 
bottom of the boat. The mission relies heavily on pilots so make sure you have some, otherwise dealing with armor
will be very difficult.<br/><br/>

Special note related to rearming vehicles, there is not yet any vehicle rearm crates, so temporarily there is a rearm
vehicle (the APC infront of the MHQ truck) that can be airlifted onto land to rearm armored vehicles.<br/><br/>

<font color='#ffab1a'>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask either Ocd or Panda through whatever medium you prefer.</font>

In the current build of this mission, the logistics system is fairly simple. You can slingload supply crates from air vehicles, or, if ace is enabled, you can
load them into the back of vehicles. Each crate is <font color='#ffab1a'>draggable</font> and takes up <font color='#ffab1a'>5 cargo space</font>.
Please note that <font color='#ffab1a'>you may not be able to move an ammo crate if it's full with ammunition</font>.<br/><br/>

There is a service pad on the LHD, which can re-arm <font color='#ffab1a'>any type of vehicle</font>.<br/><br/>

The tent system is fairly simple, it supports three types of tents currently; <font color='#ffab1a'>COMMAND</font>, <font color='#ffab1a'>MEDICAL</font> and <font color='#ffab1a'>SERVICE</font>.
The <font color='#ffab1a'>COMMAND</font> has no functionality or purpose as of right now, but will in the future.
The <font color='#ffab1a'>MEDICAL</font> provides training to players if ACE is enabled; Medics are boosted to <font color='#ffab1a'>DOCTOR</font> and regular soldiers
are boosted to <font color='#ffab1a'>MEDIC</font>.
The <font color='#ffab1a'>SERVICE</font> provides training to players if ACE is enabled; Engineers are boosted to <font color='#ffab1a'>REPAIR SPECIALIST</font> and regular soldiers
are boosted to <font color='#ffab1a'>ENGINEER</font>.<br/><br/>

This system will be expanded upon throughout updates, to create a fully player-dependable logistics system.
