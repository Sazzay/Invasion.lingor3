"Report bugs and leave feedback to discord tag ocd#0644 or Panda#8990.<br/><br/>
Admins have access to debug console and Zeus, if needed they can assist if something breaks.<br/><br/>
All air vehicles are located on deck, all land vehicles are located middle deck and there are also patrol boats at the 
bottom of the boat. The mission relies heavily on pilots so make sure you have some, otherwise dealing with armor
will be very difficult.<br/><br/>
Special note related to rearming vehicles, there is not yet any vehicle rearm crates, so temporarily there is a rearm
vehicle (the APC infront of the MHQ truck) that can be airlifted onto land to rearm armored vehicles.<br/><br/>
If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask either Ocd or Panda through whatever medium you prefer.
