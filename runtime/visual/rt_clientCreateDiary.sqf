Admins have access to debug console and Zeus, if needed they can assist if something breaks or a bug is found.<br/><br/>
All air vehicles are located on deck, all land vehicles are located middle deck and there are also patrol boats at the 
bottom of the boat. The mission relies heavily on pilots so make sure you have some, otherwise dealing with armor
will be very difficult.<br/><br/>
Special note related to rearming vehicles, there is not yet any vehicle rearm crates, so temporarily there is a rearm
vehicle (the APC infront of the MHQ truck) that can be airlifted onto land to rearm armored vehicles.<br/><br/>
If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask either Ocd or Panda through whatever medium you prefer.

You can now load and airdrop supply crates and tent crates in the back of helicopters. They take up 5 space for each crate. You can also drag them if they aren't too full of items.<br/><br/>
Tents have been added. Currently, there are three types of tents: COMMAND, MEDICAL and SERVICE. Currently, the COMMAND tent serves no purpose,
while the MEDICAL tent provides training boosting to medics, and the SERVICE tent provides training boost to engineers and a place to service vehicels.<br/><br/>
Loadouts have been revamped; Units should be carrying less weight, and more appropriate equipment. Sniper team has been abolished and united with a new team;
Recon, a 6 man team wearing incredibly light weight gear in order to travel around on foot faster. Medics, engineers and EOD should have appriopriate items for their class.
