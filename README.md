# Invasion.lingor3

Another ARMA 3 semi-dynamic mission, inspired greatly by previous works like domination or insurgency. The idea of this mission is that USMC
is conducting an island invasion of (as a first map of choice) Lingor. The composition of main objectives will be different each restart but 
typically it involves:
- Capture of towns as the main victory denominator.
- Capture of vital locations, like airfields, bases and other strategic locations that are randomized per restart.
- Destruction of resources, like ammo caches, anti-air installations, vehicle depots and more.

There will also be smaller missions to conduct in varying difficulties, examples may be:
- Rescue operations.
- VIP recovery and takedown.

All of the above represents the players offensive objectives. But the AI has objectives of their own, their objective is to repel the players
(your) invasion. They do this by enacting their own counter-offensive towards the player at varying intervals, meaning the player will always
have to stay alert, and is not always at the mercy of farming the objectives. The AI has 3 initial system under a branch I call ACS short for
Active Combat System, these are:
- Counter to air, dynamic Anti-Aircraft spawns. These vary between AA manpads to Tunguskas.
- Counter to sea, dynamic river ambushes. These will typically be infantry ambushing along the river up ahead of the players.
- Counter to land, dynamic persistent land attacks. Motorized, mechanized and air response to players conducting land operations in larger
groups. This can be anything from a BTR-80A to full blown MI-8 paratrooper assault squads.
