Build 4:
Added: Rally Points.
Added: Earpluggs on spawn.
Changed: Rewrote big parts of ADS/ACS to work on non-sched/scheduler hybrid as opposed to a pure non-sched build as before, this results in less desync
and should now be virtually eliminated.
Fixed: Service Script should now correctly refill ammo.
Fixed: Script error showing up in rpt logs should now be resolved.
